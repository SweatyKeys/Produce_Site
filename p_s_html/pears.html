      <h2>Pears Season</h2>
      <p>In general, <strong>pear harvest season starts in fall and ends depending on variety,
      in middle of Winter or even all the way till mid Spring.</strong> Due to cooling
      methods to preserve fruit, you can find the most popular varieties all 
      year round, however, the fruit won't be as good as it will be during 
      harvest season. <b>Bartlett</b> pears are harvested in late August, early September 
      through early February. <b>D'anjou</b> pears are available in late September 
      though are most commonly seen available year round. <b>Bosc</b> pears harvest 
      begins in the fall in Oregon and Washington, which lasts till the end of
      April. </p>

      <h2>Ripe Pears</h2>
      <p>Due to each pear variety being significantly different from each other,
      <strong>indicators for ripeness vary depending on the type of pear you 
      choose.</strong> <b>Bartlett pear</b> ripeness is shown by it's skin color
      . Yellow-green bartletts will have a yellow-green skin, and slightly moist
      texture. For a more sweet and juicy flavor and texture, wait for the pear
      to turn to a golden yellow hue.<b>D'anjou pear</b> ripeness will appear 
      green even when ripe. The best way to check for ripeness is to lightly 
      press near the stem site using your thumb. If the pear gives slightly it 
      is ready to eat!  </p>
      <!--The mostimportant thing to know about ***Anjou pears is that they do not
      change color as they ripen. Unlike Bartletts, another familiar green pear
      variety whose skin color does change to yellow during ripening, Green 
      Anjous will remain green even when fully ripe.
Ripen Anjou pears at room temperature. Depending on their level of ripeness when
purchased, Anjou pears may take between three and five days to become fully ripe.
Once ripe, you can store them in the refrigerator, where the ripening process 
will be slowed for a few more days.
****Bosc pears are sweeter and more flavorful earlier in the ripening 
process than other pear varieties. As a result, the complex flavor, 
honey-sweetness, and juiciness of Bosc can be enjoyed before their flesh has fully softened.
Since the flesh density of Bosc is greater than other pears, it's important to 
take this into consideration when determining when Bosc pears are ripe. The 
Check the Neck™ test, where gentle thumb pressure is applied near the stem end, 
is still the best method for checking Bosc for ripeness. However, keep in mind 
that Bosc will "give" less than other pears when they are ready. Sometimes, Bosc
will also show a slight wrinkling at the base of the stem as well as a minimal 
color change as they ripen-- a green hue under the russeted skin will turn more
yellow. However, color change is not as reliable as Checking the Neck™.
Ripen Bosc pears as you would any other variety: leave them at room temperature 
and only refrigerate after the pears have ripened.-->
