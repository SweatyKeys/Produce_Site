     <h2>Peach Season</h2>
     <p>While peaches can be seen as early as late Spring, they aren't in
     <strong> peak season until late June, and lasts till late August, early
      September.</strong>The seasons largely depend on where the supply is being
      shipped from. The biggest producer is California (which can be affected by
      drought), and other producing states include, Texas, Florida, Georgia, 
      North and South Carolina, and Virginia.</p>

    <h2>Ripe Peaches</h2>
    <p>There are three <strong>indicators for a ripe peach being color, feel and
    smell.></strong>Look for a deep golden hue behind the red blush of the fruit
    . Any green color near the stem, flat spots, or bruises should be avoided 
    as well. There are a few signs that the feel of a peach can indicate. If the 
    fruit feels hard as a rock, the peach will unlikely ever become ripe as it 
    was picked too early. If it feels similar to a tennis ball, it is not ready 
    to eat, however leave it for a few days, and it will ripen. A peach that
    yields lightly to gentle pressure are ready, and even those that are soft,
    are considered to be eaten right away. There is a thing as too soft, being
    a sign of bruising, which can happen even without being handled too much. 
    they can be salvaged as edible, however messy and possibly made better for 
    other uses such as a sauce or stirred in yogurt.
