    <h2>Plum Season</h2>
    </p> Plum season <strong>starts in May, and lasts till October,</strong>
    with over 100 of the 2,000 plus varieties being available in the United
    States. While "winter plums" can be found after the traditional season, and 
    even in early Spring, that is simply because they are grown all over the 
    world where seasons vary different times of the year. Most plums grown in 
    the United States are produced in California, where during the winter, you 
    can find the fruit originating from Chile.</p>

    <h2>Ripe Plums</h2>
    <p>The three indicators to a <strong>ripe plum are color, feel and smell.
    </strong>A plum can come in a variety of colors depending on variety,
    however, this fruit should have a deep, even color. A light color, or even
    hints of green show that it was harvested too early. The feel of a plum 
    should have a slight yield to gentle pressure. Ripe fruit should have a 
    sweet aroma, and is a good indicator to the fruit being ripe.</p>
