    <h2>Avocado Season</h2>
    <p>In 2002, California avocado growers aligned themselves with importers and 
    organized a group called Haas Avocado Board, for growers and distributors 
    to have a forum with the intent of coordinating national distribution under
    one roof. Considering the growing season for <strong>Californian avocados 
    lasts from February till August, we see supplementation nation wide
    from Mexico, whose output of avocados eclipses California's 3:1 with their
    growing of avocados lasting nearly all year long.</strong> With that being
    said, the United States also supplements their demand for the fruit with avocados from
    Peru, Chile, Dominican Republic and New Zealand.</p>

    <h2>Ripe Avocados</h2>
    <p>Two indicators for a ripe avocado are <strong>color and feel.</strong>
    A ripe avocado will have dark skin, and a slight give to gentle pressure. It
    will feel soft, but not mushy, and for the love of all that is holy,<strong>
    do not firmly grip it, till it gives, because you are only bruising the 
    delicious fruit inside.</strong>Bright green colored fruit, that feel rock 
    hard will ripen in 4 to 5 days. "Breaking" avocados which have a darker skin
    , and that feel softer, but do not yield under gentle pressure, will take 
    one to two days to ripen. To speed the ripen process, but the unripened 
    fruit in a brown paper bag with a banana or apple.</p>
