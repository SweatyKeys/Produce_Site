    <h2>Tomato Season</h2>
    <p>Peak tomato <strong>harvest is the third week of July and lasts until 
    frost comes during fall.</strong>With that being said, tomatoes can be 
    purchased at grocery stores all year round. This availability comes with a 
    caveat however, being the classic beefsteak tomato we see in the produce 
    section of most big chains, come with a rather disappointing blandness in 
    flavor. The reason for blandness comes with a variety commercial growers use
    , which was bred to consistently appear with a deep red color, looking 
    delicious but with said good looks, comes with a lack of flavor. Unfortunate
    circumstances, although this can be combated by creating your own tomato 
    garden!</p>

    <h2>Ripe Tomato<h2>
    <p>Ripeness indicators for tomatoes serve better for those growing their own
    , though they may serve well during a summer farmer's market.<strong> Indicators 
    include color, texture, feel and smell.</strong>Tomatoes can ripen into 
    colors of red, orange, yellow, pink and purple. The best way to tell which 
    color the tomato maturely ripens to is looking at the bottom of the fruit, 
    because thats where the tomatoes begin to ripen first. The skin of the fruit
    should be smooth, slightly shiny and without blemishes (even small blemishes
    can indicate rot). A ripe tomato will be slightly firm though does not mean
    rock hard. As well, a ripe fruit will feel dense and heavy. A good tomato 
    will smell sweet, though from the vine will be earthy. </p>
