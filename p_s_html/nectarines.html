     <h2>Nectarine Season</h2>
     <p>Nectarines can be available as early as middle of May, though the sweeter
    varieties aren't available till June. While California produces the most,
    you can find nectarines from Washington, Georgia and South Carolina.</P>

    <h2>Ripe Nectarine</h2>
    <p>Ripe nectarines have <strong>three indicators, being color, feel and 
    smell.</strong> Look for a deep yellow color, as varieties can show a different color
    of red to their skin. If there is any hint of green, commonly seen near the
    stem end,the fruit needs a few days to ripen. A ready to eat nectarine
    should appear firm, though yield under gentle pressure. If too soft, the
    fruit is either bruised or overripe. If the fruit appears to be hard like a
    stone(tehehe), allow the fruit a few more days to ripen (though some claim 
    to enjoy a crunchy nectarine). If the nectarine has no smell, it is highly
    suspect to being underripe, as ripe fruit can be fragrant and aromatic.</p>
