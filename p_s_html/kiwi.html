    <h2>Kiwi Season</h2>
    <p>Most commercial kiwifruit are grown in New Zealand. New Zealands seasons
    are different from the United States, as our winter months are considered
    their summer months. Kiwifruit growing season lasts about 240 days within a 
    year.<strong> Harvest season begins during New Zealand Fall (March-May).
    </strong>This is supplemented by kiwifruit grown in<strong> California as well,
    which are harvested in United States Fall months (October-November).

    <h2>Ripe Kiwi</h2>
    <p>The indicators for ripe kiwi are <strong>color, feel, and smell.</strong>
    Choose kiwi that have a tan, brown color, with no green. Kiwi that are ripe,
    have a citrus fragrance, and yields to gentle pressure. If a kiwi has a hard
    ,core and a tart taste, it is unripe. Kiwi's that don't fit the description
    for being ripe, can be set out for a day or two, or be left in a paper bag
    with a banana to speed the process.</p>
