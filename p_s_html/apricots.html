      <h2>Apricot Season>
      <p> California contributes 90-95% of apricot production in the United
        States. Harvest begins <strong>late May</strong>, to <strong>mid July
        </strong>. You can find Apricots in August, which is solely from the
         state of Washington.</p>

      <h2>Ripe Apricots</h2>
      <p>Indicators for ripe apricots include color, feel, and size. A ripe
      apricot has a bright orange color. You will notice some show a bit of red 
      color to their skin, but this is from exposure to more sun, and not an 
      indicator to being more flavorful nor ripe. A ready to eat apricot will be
      lightly soft, and the more flavorful ones will be smaller in size.</p>
