  <h2>Grapefruit Season</h2>
  <p>Grapefruits are commonly grown in Texas, and Florida, although, parts
    of California are known to harvest the fruit as well. In parts of Texas
    where Winter is rather tame, the big citrus can be harvested close to year
    round. <strong>Peak season however is from October till June, with the first
    of Winter crop being texans favorite of the harvest. Florida sees similar 
    peaks in their season, however it depends on the variety</strong>which 
    includes Duncan, Red, and White Marsh grapefruit. For grapefruit in 
    California, harvest is in late summer and fall, leading into peak season for
   Texas and Florida.</p>

  <h2>Ripe Grapefruit</h2>
  <p> Indicators for a ripe grapefruit include <strong>color, feel, and shape.
   </strong>Ripe fruit will be tinted red, the deeper the color the more flavor.
   Grapefruits should feel plump, smooth, and as you hold it in your hand, feel
   heavier than it looks. Think of it like a ball, if it is hollow, it will feel
   lighter, it is filled, it will be heavier to hold like a juicy grapefruit.
   As it's in your hand, check for soft spots, as this is an indication for rot.
   Ripe grapefruits will be slightly oval with flat tops and bottoms. Any round
   at the top (underripe), or oddly shaped (overripe) aren't prime fruit.</p>
