     <h2>Oranges Season</h2>
     <p>Considering oranges is a relatively broad spectrum of citrus due to the
     different varieties commercially produced, navel oranges are possibly the
     most widely available.<strong> Navels are harvested from December through 
     March.</strong>Pink flesh<strong>cara cara's are available December till 
     April</strong>and the popular "juicing orange," <strong>velencias are
     available starting January till November.</strong>While technically a 
     hybrid, however wildly popular, clementines are available November till
     January.</p>

    <h2>Ripe Oranges</h2>
    <p>There are <strong>two indicators for a ripe orange which are feel and
    smell. </strong>Due to difficult shipping conditions, picking the fruit from
    trees is a fine balance between not too soon, and not too ripe. This is due 
    shipping fresh ripe oranges risk the chance of the fruit often being bruised 
    or rot when reaching its destination. To find the best available orange, 
    pick up fruit judging its size, compared to the weight of it in your hand.
    Heavier feeling fruit will be more likely the tastier choice. As well, smell
    the orange from where it blossoms (opposite of stem site)as oranges 
    covered by wax will give off a citrus sweet aroma when ripe. Avoid any that 
    resemble the smell of wine.</p>
