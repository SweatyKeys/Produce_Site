   <h2>Ripe Pineapple</h2>
   <p>The three indicators for <strong>ripe pineapple are color, feel and smell.
   </strong></p>A ripe pineapple sweet tasting pineapple will have a gold color, 
   from the bottom to the crown. If it is gold on the bottom and green on top,
   flavor will likely be inconsistent. The higher and more gold present, the 
   more sugar and likely hood the fruit will be sweet. When smelling the fruit,
   do so from the butt of the fruit. If the odor is sweet, the fruit is ripe, 
   and ready to eat. If there isn't much of a smell, it is unlikely to get
   sweet, as pineapple don't tend to ripen much more after picking. If there is
   an odor that is more fermented smelling, or like vinegar, it is overripe and 
   should be avoided. A ripe pineapple will also yield slightly when given a 
   little pressure.</p>
