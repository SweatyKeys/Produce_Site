    <h2>Papaya Season</h2>
    Though papayas can be found all year round, their<strong> peak season starts 
    early Summer and lasts through fall.</strong> A large quantity of papaya are
    grown in Hawaii, though California, Florida, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central
    and South America all contribute to the availability to the large fruits.

    <h2>Ripe Papaya</h2>
    <p>There are a few indicators for ripe papaya which are<strong>color, feel,
    and smell.</strong>Ripe papaya will be predominantly yellow all over. Check
    the stem site for mold or mildew, and if any present, do not buy or eat.
    Ripe fruit will yield slightly from gentle pressure to the skin. Smell the 
    papaya from the stem site, where it should have a light sweet scent. </p>
